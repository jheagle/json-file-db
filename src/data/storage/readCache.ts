 * writes. Outside any task nothing is cached and every read goes to storage, as before.
 *
 * The cache holds text, not parsed objects: every read parses its own copy, so a caller changing what it read (a join
 * attaches rows to the rows it read) never changes what the next reader gets.
 *
 * withDatabaseLock runs every public call (query, create, drop, describe) inside one, so the cache lasts one call. In

 * until the last one ends, which is safe because nothing is written there.
