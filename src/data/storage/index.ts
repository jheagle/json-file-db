/**
 * The storage layer: every file json-fs-query reads, writes or deletes goes through these functions, and nothing else
 * touches `fs` or `fetch()`. Paths given to them are inside the database (see storagePath).
 *
 * Today there is one backend, JSON files (on disk in Node, over fetch() in a browser). Keeping it behind these few
 * functions is what lets a read cache, batched writes and other storage backends come later without touching queries.
