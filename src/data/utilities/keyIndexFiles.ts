 * The entry files a key's index lists for the values `matches` accepts, in the record's own order (the order its rows
 * are read in). A composite key's index holds its combined value (see computeKeyValue), so `matches` is given that.
 *
 * Undefined when the key has no index, or its file can't be read or parsed: the caller then looks through every row.
 * The files are candidates: callers read each one and check its value, and look through the rows for any value the
 * index didn't lead to, so an index that's out of step with the rows costs time, never a wrong result.
